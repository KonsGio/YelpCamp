<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![https://kgio.dev][product-screenshot]](https://kgio.dev)
YelpCamp is a full-stack web application that I developed using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Inspired by the popular Yelp platform, YelpCamp allows users to browse and review campgrounds, as well as create their own campground listings.

The application includes many features such as user authentication, authorization, and password encryption, which ensure the security of the users' personal information. Users can search for campgrounds by location or name, view detailed campground information, including images and reviews, and add their own reviews and ratings.

Additionally, the application includes a feature-rich campground creation form, which allows users to create their own campgrounds, complete with descriptions, images, and location details. The campground listings are displayed in an interactive map and can be filtered by various attributes such as price and rating.

Overall, YelpCamp is a robust and engaging web application that provides a complete and interactive experience for users interested in finding, reviewing, and creating campgrounds

### Built With

This is the final project from Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022". In this project, I exercised my learnings in:

- **HTML**

- **CSS** (Bootstrap)

- **JavaScript** (EJS, Node.JS, Express)

- **MongoDB** + Mongoose

- **APIs** (REST)

- **MVC** architecture

And practiced working with tools that I have never had any experience before, like:

- **Passport** for authentication, authorization and cryptography

- **JOI** for data validation

- and **EJS Mate** made my development process a lot faster with boilerplating
